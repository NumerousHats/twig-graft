# twig-graft

Construct "twigs" from Greek Catholic birth and death records that have been transcribed into a CSV file, search for overlaps between them, and "graft" those twigs onto each other.

This is a very much a work in progress. More documentation will appear here eventually, but in the meantime, if you are interested in understanding the code or want to help out, please open an issue or reach out on Twitter (@NumerousHats).
